YXCMS code audit

[suggested description]

In the root directory“D:\phpStudy\WWW\1\protected\apps\default\view\default\extend_guestbook.php”
In the fortieth line code under the page：name='content'The variable does not have filtering input and output leading to the existence of a XSS vulnerability
Include
“D:\phpStudy\WWW\1\protected\apps\default\view\mobile\extend_guestbook.php”
Of the fifty-third lines of code under the pageThe variable：name='content'Filtering without input and output leads to the existence of a XSS vulnerability

[additional information]

Yxcms building system (compatible cell phone) v1.4.7 debug
The source code has a XSS vulnerability
The cause of the loophole is:

This vulnerability can be executed by the malicious code that is entered at the position of the input box

Methods that cause defects:

In the root directory“D:\phpStudy\WWW\1\protected\apps\default\view\default\extend_guestbook.php”
In the fortieth line code under the page：name='content'The variable does not have filtering input and output leading to the existence of a XSS vulnerability
Include
“D:\phpStudy\WWW\1\protected\apps\default\view\mobile\extend_guestbook.php”
Of the fifty-third lines of code under the pageThe variable：name='content'Filtering without input and output leads to the existence of a XSS vulnerability

The location of the vulnerability in the source code:

In the fortieth line code under this page“name='content'”There is no filter input and output that leads to the existence of XSS

That's the thirty-sixth line code you see now“name='content'”

D:\phpStudy\WWW\1\protected\apps\default\view\mobile\extend_guestbook.php
              </div>
              <div class="control-group">
                <label class="control-label" for="inputEmail">Message:</label><div class="controls"><textarea name='content' cols="30" rows="4"></textarea></div>
                
And the following code is in：
D:\phpStudy\WWW\1\protected\apps\default\view\default\extIllegal characters without filtering output and input lead to the existence of XSSend_guestbook.php
In the fifty-third lines of the code“name='content'”Illegal characters without filtering output and input lead to the existence of XSS
                
[vulnerability hazard]           
An attacker can insert malicious code into a web page to cause the user
Or the administrator triggers the vulnerability, which may lead to
Administrator or user vulnerability, which may lead to
The server crashes.

An environment that triggers a vulnerability:
Malicious users only need to insert malicious code in the message board to trigger the vulnerability
